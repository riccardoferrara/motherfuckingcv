        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <aside>
            Curriculum Vitae. <br />
            Breath my friend: this is a static, black and white curriculum, I
            have been recruiter too and I know that your eyes may need some
            rest.
        </aside>
        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>
            Following a fulfilling academic journey that included earning a PhD,
            completing postdoctoral work, and teaching at a university level, I
            embarked on a new adventure by creating a patented software that
            would eventually serve as the foundation for my start-up, Sim&Cure.
            In my role at Sim&Cure, I had the opportunity to experience a
            diverse range of roles, from spearheading R&D projects (utilizing
            Python and C++) to leading quality management protocols across
            various departments, including risk management, clinical validation,
            training, production, and customer support. Thanks to our team's
            tireless efforts, we achieved CE marking for our medical devices, as
            well as ISO13485 and FDA510(k) certifications.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my key contributions to Sim&Cure was designing our platform
            on Salesforce, which allowed us to link all our activities through a
            centralized database. I oversaw the implementation of this platform,
            which facilitated customer support ticketing, R&D ticketing,
            non-conformity management, product releases, versioning, pay-per-use
            usage tokens, licensing, invoicing, internal and external
            certification training, and clinical validation. During my time at
            Sim&Cure, I also played a vital role in scaling the company during
            two fundraising rounds and launching our satellite office in the
            United States, where I worked closely with customers to evangelize
            our technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following my tenure at Sim&Cure, I designed and developed several
            exciting projects for the Italian railway network, including
            interactive maps (using Node, Python, and HTML), a purchasing
            request management platform (utilizing SQL), and weather alert
            systems (using Node and Python). Additionally, I created an
            e-commerce platform for another client using WordPress, JavaScript,
            and HTML. Recently, I had the pleasure of teaching at Tortuga
            Coders, a highly regarded web development bootcamp, where I taught
            courses on Node, SQL, React, and Express.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I hold the position of Lead Developer at Foundever
            (formerly known as Sitel Group), one of the world's largest
            outsourcing companies. In this role, I continue to utilize my
            extensive skills in software design, development, and
            implementation, while also taking on new challenges and
            opportunities for growth.

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <h3>
            Full Stack Lead Developer at Foundever | 10/2023 - nowdays | France
        </h3>
        <p>
            As the lead developer in a dynamic Scrum/Agile team of 10 talented
            individuals, I find myself collaborating with colleagues who are
            scattered across the globe - from France, to China, to Brazil.
            Despite our geographic distance, we work closely together to ensure
            that our projects are always on track, with daily communication in
            both French and English.
        </p>
        <p>
            At present, our team is focused on managing an impressive 80
            e-learning platforms, each of which hosts a staggering total of more
            than 120,000 users. It's a challenging task, but one that we take on
            with enthusiasm and a dedication to quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for my day-to-day responsibilities, I spend much of my time
            writing code in a range of languages, including Python, Javascript,
            Typescript, HTML, and CSS. Our tech stack is built on a foundation
            of powerful tools and frameworks, such as Django, Node, React, Vue,
            and Sass, while our databases of choice are MySQL and MongoDB.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the unique aspects of my job is that it is fully remote,
            allowing me to work from anywhere in the world - yet my home base
            remains in the beautiful city of Montpellier. It's a privilege to be
            part of a team that is truly global in scope, and to have the
            opportunity to contribute to such impactful projects from the
            comfort of my own home.

        <h3>
            Web Development Teacher and Manager at Tortuga Coders | 05/2022 -
            07/2022 | Thailand
        </h3>
        <p>
            During this exciting period of my career, I had the opportunity to
            work at a bootcamp for fullstack developers - and not just any
            bootcamp, but the very same one that I had attended as a student! It
            was a truly nostalgic experience to be back in that environment,
            surrounded by the buzz of aspiring coders hard at work.
        </p>
        <p>
            As it turned out, my previous exposure to the school's curriculum
            had left me well-equipped for a role as both a teacher and a
            manager. In my capacity as a teacher, I relished the chance to guide
            students through the various phases of their learning journey - from
            mastering the basics of html and javascript, to diving into more
            advanced topics like react, express, mongoDB, and mySQL.
        </p>
        <p>
            And as a manager, I was responsible for ensuring that the bootcamp
            ran like a well-oiled machine. This involved not only handling some
            of the hiring responsibilities, but also overseeing the on-site
            accommodation of our students. All in all, it was an incredibly
            fulfilling experience, and one that allowed me to give back to a
            community that had given so much to me in the past
