        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <aside>
            Curriculum Vitae. <br />
            Breath my friend: this is a static, black and white curriculum, I
            have been recruiter too and I know that your eyes may need some
            rest.
        </aside>
        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>
            After a university experience (PhD, postdoc, teaching), I created a
            software, which I patented and which led to the creation of a
            start-up: Sim&Cure. Within this start-up, which I accompanied from
            the first employee to 30 employees, I was able to wear different
            hats by gaining experience in the R&D world first (python and c++),
            and then in practically all the other processes for which I wrote
            and executed the SMQ protocols. In order: risk management, clinical
            validation, training (internal and external), production and
            customer support. We therefore obtained CE marking for medical
            devices, ISO13485, FDA510(k).
        </p>
        <p>
            Among other things, I designed on Salesforce our platform which
            allowed us to link all our activities through a common database:
            customer support ticketing / R&D ticketing / non-conformity (SMQ) /
            product releases / versioning / pay-per-use usage tokens / licensing
            / invoicing / internal and external certification-training /
            clinical validation. After designing it, I contributed directly to
            the project's implementation. I accompanied the company's scaling
            during 2 fundraising rounds and finally trained employees and
            launched our satellite on American soil: Sim&Cure US. Always in
            contact with end customers, during this 5-year adventure, I visited
            many countries around the world to evangelize the technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            After this great experience, I was able to design and develop
            several projects for the Italian railway network: interactive maps
            (tech: node + python + html), a purchasing request management
            platform (tech: SQL), weather alert systems (tech: node + python);
            as well as an e-commerce platform for another client (tech: wp, js,
            html). Recently, I also taught at a web development bootcamp:
            Tortuga Coders, where I taught Node, SQL, React, and Express
            courses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today I cover the position of Lead Developer at one of the world's
            largest outsourcing companies: Sitel Group.
        </p>

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <h3>Full Stack Lead Developer at Sitel Group</h3>
        <p>
            I am the lead developer in a Scrum/Agile team of 10 people scattered
            across France, China, and Brazil. In close contact with the Project
            Manager and Product Owner, I communicate daily in French and English
            with the dev team. At the moment, we are managing 80 e-learning
            platforms hosting more than 120,000 users in total. Currently, I
            mainly write code in Python, Javascript, Typescript, HTML, and CSS.
            Our stack is based on Django, Node, React, Vue, Sass, while we use
            mysql and MongoDB as databases.
        </p>

        <h3>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

        <p>
            You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking
            website. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass
            banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent
            hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some
            motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers
            will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see
            that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.
        </p>

        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>

        <h2>It's fucking lightweight</h2>

        <p>
            This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo
            on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of
            jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of
            a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you
            could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You
            piece of shit.
        </p>

        <h2>It's responsive</h2>

        <p>
            You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive,
            but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking
            screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an
            iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.
        </p>

        <h2>It fucking works</h2>

        <p>
            Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read,
            motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's
            using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the
            fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.
        </p>

        <p>
            It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines
            and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full
            screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool
            the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I
            fucking dare you.
        </p>

        <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>

        <p>
            Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his
            true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is.
            All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of
            what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real,
            naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.
        </p>

        <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

        <p>
            I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What
            I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are
            <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by
            default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You
            break them. You son-of-a-bitch.
        </p>

        <p>
            From the philosophies expressed (poorly) above,
            <a href="http://txti.es">txti</a> was created. You should try it
            today to make your own motherfucking websites.
