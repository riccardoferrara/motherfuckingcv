        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <aside>
            Curriculum Vitae. <br />
            Breath my friend: this is a static, black and white curriculum, I
            have been recruiter too and I know that your eyes may need some
            rest.
        </aside>
        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>
            Following a fulfilling academic journey that included earning a PhD,
            completing postdoctoral work, and teaching at a university level, I
            embarked on a new adventure by creating a patented software that
            would eventually serve as the foundation for my start-up, Sim&Cure.
            In my role at Sim&Cure, I had the opportunity to experience a
            diverse range of roles, from spearheading R&D projects (utilizing
            Python and C++) to leading quality management protocols across
            various departments, including risk management, clinical validation,
            training, production, and customer support. Thanks to our team's
            tireless efforts, we achieved CE marking for our medical devices, as
            well as ISO13485 and FDA510(k) certifications.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my key contributions to Sim&Cure was designing our platform
            on Salesforce, which allowed us to link all our activities through a
            centralized database. I oversaw the implementation of this platform,
            which facilitated customer support ticketing, R&D ticketing,
            non-conformity management, product releases, versioning, pay-per-use
            usage tokens, licensing, invoicing, internal and external
            certification training, and clinical validation. During my time at
            Sim&Cure, I also played a vital role in scaling the company during
            two fundraising rounds and launching our satellite office in the
            United States, where I worked closely with customers to evangelize
            our technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following my tenure at Sim&Cure, I designed and developed several
            exciting projects for the Italian railway network, including
            interactive maps (using Node, Python, and HTML), a purchasing
            request management platform (utilizing SQL), and weather alert
            systems (using Node and Python). Additionally, I created an
            e-commerce platform for another client using WordPress, JavaScript,
            and HTML. Recently, I had the pleasure of teaching at Tortuga
            Coders, a highly regarded web development bootcamp, where I taught
            courses on Node, SQL, React, and Express.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I hold the position of Lead Developer at Foundever
            (formerly known as Sitel Group), one of the world's largest
            outsourcing companies. In this role, I continue to utilize my
            extensive skills in software design, development, and
            implementation, while also taking on new challenges and
            opportunities for growth.

        <h3>
            Full Stack Lead Developer at Foundever | 10/2023 - nowdays | Paris
        </h3>
        <p>
            As the lead developer in a dynamic Scrum/Agile team of 10 talented
            individuals, I find myself collaborating with colleagues who are
            scattered across the globe - from France, to China, to Brazil.
            Despite our geographic distance, we work closely together to ensure
            that our projects are always on track, with daily communication in
            both French and English.
        </p>
        <p>
            At present, our team is focused on managing an impressive 80
            e-learning platforms, each of which hosts a staggering total of more
            than 120,000 users. It's a challenging task, but one that we take on
            with enthusiasm and a dedication to quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for my day-to-day responsibilities, I spend much of my time
            writing code in a range of languages, including Python, Javascript,
            Typescript, HTML, and CSS. Our tech stack is built on a foundation
            of powerful tools and frameworks, such as Django, Node, React, Vue,
            and Sass, while our databases of choice are MySQL and MongoDB.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the unique aspects of my job is that it is fully remote,
            allowing me to work from anywhere in the world - yet my home base
            remains in the beautiful city of Montpellier. It's a privilege to be
            part of a team that is truly global in scope, and to have the
            opportunity to contribute to such impactful projects from the
            comfort of my own home.

            07/2022 | Thailand
        </h3>
        <p>
            During this exciting period of my career, I had the opportunity to
            work at a bootcamp for fullstack developers - and not just any
            bootcamp, but the very same one that I had attended as a student! It
            was a truly nostalgic experience to be back in that environment,
            surrounded by the buzz of aspiring coders hard at work.
        </p>
        <p>
            As it turned out, my previous exposure to the school's curriculum
            had left me well-equipped for a role as both a teacher and a
            manager. In my capacity as a teacher, I relished the chance to guide
            students through the various phases of their learning journey - from
            mastering the basics of html and javascript, to diving into more
            advanced topics like react, express, mongoDB, and mySQL.
        </p>
        <p>
            And as a manager, I was responsible for ensuring that the bootcamp
            ran like a well-oiled machine. This involved not only handling some
            of the hiring responsibilities, but also overseeing the on-site
            accommodation of our students. All in all, it was an incredibly
            fulfilling experience, and one that allowed me to give back to a
            community that had given so much to me in the past

        <!-- <p>
            Ho lavorato per RFI da freelance creando diversi progetti. Il più
            interessante è stato senz'altro quello della creazione di un GIS per
            la registrazione e visualizzazione di informazioni inerenti a
            determinati punti di interesse quali passaggi a livello, ponti
            ferroviari o segmenti di linea. Ho realizzato il tutto su una stack
            python/js/html/css/mysql servendomi delle API di google per
            sfruttare le loro mappe ed il loro sistema di navigazione. Sempre
            per RFI ho realizzato anche un sistema di allerta meteo, ed ho
            coperto il ruolo di PM per l'integrazione e la customizzazione di un
            sistema di gestione delle richieste d'acquisto (arxivar).
        </p> -->
        <!-- <p>
            Sempre da freelance mi sono divertito a seguire numerosi altri
            progetti, prevalentemente siti internet ed e-commerce realizzati su
            wordpress e poi profondamente customizzati con PHP e js.
        </p> -->
        <p>
            As a freelance consultant for RFI, I have had the opportunity to
            work on a range of exciting projects. Among them, the creation of a
            Geographic Information System (GIS) to register and visualize
            information on specific points of interest - including level
            crossings, railway bridges, and line segments - stands out as
            particularly captivating. With my expertise in Python, JS, HTML,
            CSS, and MySQL, I was able to develop the GIS from the ground up,
            while also leveraging Google APIs to incorporate their cutting-edge
            mapping and navigation system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I designed and implemented a customized weather alert
            system for RFI, further enhancing their ability to operate
            effectively and safely in all conditions. And as a project manager,
            I was responsible for overseeing the successful integration and
            customization of a purchase request management system (Arxivar),
            streamlining the procurement process for RFI's teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a freelancer, I also had the pleasure of working on numerous
            other projects, primarily websites and e-commerce platforms built on
            WordPress and then extensively customized using PHP and JS. It was a
            rewarding experience to see my clients' visions come to life through
            my technical skills and creativity.

            In questo mio ultimo capitolo presso Sim&Cure ho partecipato allo
            scaling-up della nostra start-up sfruttando anche un grosso
            investimento esterno che ci ha permesso, tra l'altre cose, di aprire
            il mercato in america. Ho seguito in prima persona l'apertura di
            Sim&Cure negli stati uniti, selezionando, formando e costruendo il
            team fulcro del quartiere generale della società a New York. Allo
            stesso tempo ho seguito un progetto chiave per digitalizzazione
            della gestione del sistema di qualità facendo guadagnare tempo e
            qualità alla squadra prodotto ed allo stesso tempo migliorando la
            tracciabilità grazie alla centralizzazione ed interoperabilità dei
            dati del post market service, dei commerciali, delle vendite, delle
            certicicazioni e dei rilasci delle versioni del software. E' stato
            durante questo capitolo che abbiamo ottenuto l'approvazione per
            vendere negli USA: FDA 510(k).
        </p> -->
        <p>
            In my final chapter at Sim&Cure, I played a key role in the
            scaling-up of our start-up, which was made possible through a
            significant external investment. This enabled us to expand our
            market reach to America, among other things. I personally oversaw
            the opening of Sim&Cure in the United States, handpicking, training,
            and building the core team at the company's headquarters in New
            York. At the same time, I spearheaded a critical project to digitize
            our quality management system, which not only saved time and
            improved the quality of our product team but also enhanced
            traceability through the centralization and interoperability of
            post-market service data, sales, certifications, and software
            releases. It was during this chapter that we obtained FDA 510(k)
            approval to sell in the US.

            I took on the role of drafting marketing strategies and coordinating
            the training of our commercial representatives and application
            engineers, while also spearheading the implementation of quality
            management procedures for both the marketing and training
            department, as well as the clinical validation department.

            Moreover, during my time here, I had the distinct privilege of
            formalizing the patent for our incredible product, Sim&Size. It was
            an exciting and challenging process, but we eventually obtained the
            patent, which was a monumental achievement for me, the inventor, and
            our team. Over the years, we also proudly obtained the CE mark for
            medical devices (Class IIa, 93/42/CE) and ISO 13485 certification.
            It has been an exhilarating adventure, and I am eager to see what
            the future holds for our remarkable start-up.

        <!-- <p>
            Il mio primo capitolo a Sim&Cure. Qui introduco la mia invenzione
            alla società, ne affino il funzionamento e l'esperienza
            utilizzatore. Traduco il cuore dell'algoritmo in C++. Parallelamente
            svolgo le validazioni cliniche del nostro dispositivo medico. In un
            primo momento tramite simulazioni numeriche FEM, che mi hanno anche
            permesso di calibrare certi parametri di uno dei moduli del nostro
            software; in un secondo momento ho redatto un vero e proprio
            protocollo di validazione clinica in collaborazione con il repardo
            di neuroradiologia dell'ospedale di Montpellier. Validazione che ci
            permetterà in seguito di ottenere il marchio CE.
        </p> -->
        <p>
            My first chapter at Sim&Cure involved introducing my invention to
            the company, refining its functionality, and improving the user
            experience. Additionally, I translated the heart of the algorithm
            into C++, while simultaneously conducting clinical validations of
            our medical device. Initially, I performed numerical FEM
            simulations, which allowed me to calibrate certain parameters of one
            of our software modules. Later on, in collaboration with the
            neuroradiology department of the Montpellier hospital, I developed a
            complete clinical validation protocol. This validation will enable
            us to obtain the CE marking in the future.

            As a postdoctoral researcher, I conducted a study aimed at
            optimizing intracranial medical devices (IMDs) for the treatment of
            intracranial aneurysms. Specifically, I evaluated the influence of
            geometrical parameters of arteries and flow-diverter devices on
            bloodstream and aneurysm thrombosis. To achieve this, I utilized
            different mock-up/models to evaluate the pressure drop due to the
            presence of flow-diverter devices. Additionally, I developed a
            numerical model that accurately predicts the pressure drop and
            thrombosis phenomenon in in-vivo cases. This model was calibrated
            and tested by comparing it to experimental results. The results of
            this study have the potential to significantly improve the efficacy
            and safety of IMDs for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.

        <h3>Inventor | 10/2014 - 04/2015 | Montpellier</h3>
        <!-- <p>
            Appassionato dalla biomeccanica, ispirato dal mio mentore, direttore
            della tesi di dottorato da poco conseguita, mi sono appassionato
            alle tematiche legate al trattamento endovascolare tramite
            flow-diverter degli aneurismi cerebrali. In questi mesi, in maniera
            autonoma e non retribuita, ho sviluppato l'invenzione che ha segnato
            i miei anni successivi e che è stata all'origine di una grande
            avventura: un dispositivo medico capace di simulare in tempo reale
            il comportamento delle protesi basandosi sulle immagini
            scannerizzate del paziente (Cone Beam CT), dando la possibilità al
            neuroradiologo di scegliere la protesi più adatta, e di avere una
            guida durante l'intervento.
        </p> -->
        <!-- <p>
            Per i geeks: ho sviluppato l'intero prototipo in python, sfruttando
            le librerie VTK, ITK e CTK. Per realizzare il prototipo ho dovuto
            mixare le mie competenze informatiche con quelle ingegneristiche,
            passando da una vettorializzazione 3d delle arterie a partire da
            delle immagini in scala di grigio, ed in seguito creando un modello
            meccanico delle protesi calcolabile in modo rapido ma accurato
            (simil FEM).
        </p> -->
        <p>
            Driven by my passion for biomechanics and inspired by my mentor, who
            directed my recently completed PhD thesis, I became deeply
            interested in endovascular treatment using flow-diverters for
            cerebral aneurysms. In the following months, I independently and
            voluntarily developed an invention that marked the beginning of a
            thrilling journey: a medical device that can simulate the behavior
            of prostheses in real-time, based on the patient's scanned images
            (Cone Beam CT). This invention provides neuroradiologists with the
            ability to choose the most suitable prosthesis and receive guidance
            during the procedure. Today I am the named inventor of this patented
            invention and I am very proud of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the geeks out there: I developed the entire prototype using
            Python, leveraging the VTK, ITK, and CTK libraries. To bring the
            prototype to life, I had to blend my computer science skills with my
            engineering knowledge, starting from a 3D vectorization of arteries
            from grayscale images, and then creating a mechanical model of
            prostheses that could be calculated quickly yet accurately (similar
            to FEM).
